When you want to backup vimrc into public repository service such as GitHub, you may put secret informations out of vimrc.

pypit.vim (and its parents, pitconfig.vim and rbpit.vim) can.

As pitconfig.vim requires Perl interface, and rbpit.vim requires Ruby interface, pypit.vim requires Python interface.
