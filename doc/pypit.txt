    Reload pit config named as |g:pypit_default|.

:PitSave                                                             *:PitSave*
    Save current variables to pit config named as |g:pypit_default|.

    Save current variables to pit config named as 'profile'.

:PitShow                                                             *:PitShow*

===============================================================================
VARIABLES                                                     *pypit-variables*

g:pypit_default                                               *g:pypit_default*
    Default profile name of pit config.
>
    let g:pypit_default = 'vimrc'
<

g:pypit_autoload                                             *g:pypit_autoload*
    pypit doesn't load pit config automatically if this variable sets 0.  If
    you don't want autoloading, write the following in your |vimrc|:
>
    let g:pypit_autoload = 0
<

BUGS                                                               *pypit-bugs*

- |:PitAdd| and so on treat numbers as strings.  (maybe Vim's bug...)
  |:PitEdit| avoids this bug, so you may launch it after adding number
  variables.  I hope to fix it. Any help is welcome!
